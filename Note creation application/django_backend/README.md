Secure Web Application - Notes
This repository contains the code for a secure web application that allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The application is built using Flutter for the front-end and Django for the back-end.

Flutter Front-end
Overview
The Flutter front-end provides the user interface for the secure web application. It includes screens for user registration, login, note creation, viewing, and deletion.

Installation
Ensure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, follow the official installation guide: Flutter Installation.

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-webapp-notes.git
Navigate to the flutter_frontend directory:
cd secure-webapp-notes/flutter_frontend
Install the required dependencies:


flutter pub get
Usage
Run the Flutter application:

flutter run
The application will open on your connected device or emulator. You can now interact with the secure web application.

Django Back-end
Overview
The Django back-end provides the server-side logic and API endpoints for user registration, authentication, note creation, viewing, and deletion.

Installation
Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your machine. If not, follow the official installation guide: Django Installation.

Important Note
This is a simplified example to demonstrate the project structure and setup. For a complete and secure web application, additional implementation and security measures are required, such as proper data validation, secure password storage, HTTPS configuration, and more.

Please ensure you handle sensitive data and credentials securely. In a production environment, use secure connections (HTTPS) and follow best practices to safeguard user data and maintain the security of your web application.
